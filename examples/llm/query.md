# Ethanol degradation

Within this project we are studying the degradation of ethanol. For this we have used the following molecules:

| Name         | Formula |
|--------------|---------|
| Ethanol      | C2H5OH  |
| Acetaldehyde | C2H4O   |

We have conducted multiple experiments with the following concentrations:

| Experiment ID | Molecule      | Concentration | Unit     |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| 1             | Ethanol       | 100           | mol / l  |
| 1             | Acetaldeyhyde | 200           | mol / l  |
| 2             | Ethanol       | 50            | mmol / l |
| 2             | Acetaldeyhyde | 20            | mol / l  |
| 3             | Ethanol       | 10            | g / l    |
| 3             | Acetaldeyhyde | 5             | mg / l   |
| 4             | Ethanol       | 1             | mol / l  |
| 4             | Acetaldeyhyde | 2             | mM       |
