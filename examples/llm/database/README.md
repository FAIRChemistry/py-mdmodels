# WORK IN PROGRESS

This example is pretty cool, but still work in progress. There will be a more detailed documentation soon, but in a nutshell:

- We use the `create.py` script to generate the SQLAlchemy models from the MDModel specification.
- We then use the `query.py` script to query the database with an LLM - safely!
